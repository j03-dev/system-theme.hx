# system-theme.hx

system-theme.hx is a theme switcher plugin for [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/) that automatically adapts to your system's appearance (dark/light mode).

## Usage

Add the following to `init.scm` in your Helix config directory:

```scheme
(require "system-theme-hx/system-theme.scm")
(auto-theme "tokyonight_moon" "github_light")
```

This plugin provides the `auto-theme` function that automatically switches between dark and light themes based on system preference.

### Examples

```scheme
;; Gruvbox variants
(auto-theme "gruvbox_dark_hard" "gruvbox_light_hard")

;; Catppuccin variants
(auto-theme "catppuccin_mocha" "catppuccin_latte")
```
